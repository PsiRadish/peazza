Where max number of pizzas and toppings per pizza allows, every pizza will meet all the needs and have none of the hates of at least 1 person.

Conversely, under the same conditions each person will have at least 1 pizza that meets all their needs and has none of their hates.
    
(What about when conditions don't allow?)

Each person MUST get every topping they NEED, and SHOULD get at least 1 more topping that they want than toppings that they meh.

(Meh is a verb now.)

ALGORISHM

Determine where, if anywhere, needs and hates conflict between persons and put them in separate groups as needed ("harmonies").

Within each harmony:
    Construct a "working pizza" meeting all of the harmony's needs. (Also remember it as the "needs pizza" for use as a fallback?)
    
    < If there are no want/meh conflicts in the harmony (and topping limits allow?), put everyone's wants on the working pizza and return it to the event.
    
    Otherwise, construct a list of all wanted toppings in the harmony and calculate a rating for each:
        +1 for each person who wants it
        -1 for each person who mehs it
    Toppings with a rating of at least 1(?) will be added to the working pizza.
    
    If working pizza now has at least 1 more wanted topping than mehed topping for each person in harmony.
